1. Factory Class is responsible for creating appropriate object.
2. Client is not responsible for creating exact object, client will only say which type of object
   they want to create.


3. Example:
   Imagine a vehicle rental company that rents out different types of vehicles.
   Customers might request a vehicle based on their need (e.g., "car," "bike," or "truck").
   The company doesn't want to manage the complex details of creating each type of vehicle every
   time a request is made, so it uses a Vehicle Factory.
