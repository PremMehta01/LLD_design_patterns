1. We have a MediaPlayer interface and a concrete class AudioPlayer implementing the MediaPlayer interface.
   AudioPlayer can play mp3 format audio files by default.

 2. We are having another interface AdvancedMediaPlayer and concrete classes implementing the
    AdvancedMediaPlayer interface. These classes can play vlc and mp4 format files.

 3. We want to make AudioPlayer to play other formats as well.

 4. To attain this, we have created an adapter class MediaAdapter which implements the MediaPlayer
    interface and uses AdvancedMediaPlayer objects to play the required format.
